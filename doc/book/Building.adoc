# Step by step building documentation 

## Initial setup

Make sur you have all the dependencies installed for both feel++ and angiotk.

Feel++ requires at least:
* openmpi
* petsc/slepc
* gmsh
* boost

Advice regarding to compiler: prefer the use of clang instead of gcc (less memory and less compilation time).

Angiotk requires at least:
* feel++
* openmpi
* ITK
* vmtk

## Building

### Feel++

To build Feel++, please refer to the Feel++ documentation.
You will have to install Feel++, so you might want to set up an installation path with `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="..."` (if you don't want to install Feel++ in your system), then build and install Feel++ with `make install-feelpp`.

Once Feel++ is installed, you need to export the `FEELPP_DIR` variable in your shell (e.g. put it in your .bashrc file). Set it to the installation directory of Feel++ (to one you previously set at the cmake step).

### VMTK

If you can install vmtk through your package system, you should do it this way, it would be easier. 

<!--
If you need to build vmtk, pay attention to the library versions you will use.
As of version 1.2, it has been built successfully with ITK 4.8.0 and VTK 5.10.1 (It won't work with VTK 6.x.y version).

Confirmed cmake working commands for installation:   
* ITK 4.8.0:    
```
cmake <itk_source_dir> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<itk_install_dir> -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON -DITKV3_COMPATIBILITY=ON -DITK_USE_REVIEW=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
```
`ITKV3_COMPATIBILITY` and `ITK_USE_REVIEW` are required for vmtk to work.      
`BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON` is optional, but very recommended. There is a code example that allows to convert DICOM data to the mha format.   
   
Export the ITK_DIR variable to the install directory.

* VTK 5.10.1:   
```
cmake <vtk_source_dir> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<vtk_install_dir> -DVTK_Group_MPI=ON -DVTK_Group_Qt=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DVTK_WRAP_PYTHON=ON
```   
You need at least `VTK_WRAP_PYTHON`.
   
Export the VTK_DIR variable to the install directory.
   
* VMTK 1.2   
```
cmake <vmtk_source_dir> -DUSE_SYSTEM_ITK=ON -DUSE_SYSTEM_VTK=ON
```   
Here we use the ITK and VTK that we just configured and installed in the system.
   
Export the VMTK_DIR or VMTKHOME variable to the install directory.

For all those libraries, you might need to setup `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` ... or use the module command.
-->

If you prefer to build VMTK, the easiest way to do it is with the SuperBuild option. It will build VMTK and all its dependencies in a single directory, you will thus avoid compatibility issues.

First clone vmtk with git and select the version you want:

```
# Cloning vmtk and go into the directory
git clone https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk.git
cd vmtk

# By default, you will be on top of the master branch
# If you want to switch to a previous release, use the git checkout command
# To check available releases, use the git show-ref command

# Example: going to VMTK 1.2
git checkout refs/tags/v1.2

# Example: going to VMTK 1.3
git checkout refs/tags/v1.3
```

By default VMTK will perform a SuperBuild, you can use the following commands (in the vmtk directory):

```
# First create a build directory to build outside of the source code 
mkdir build
cd build

# The use the following command template
# cmake <vmtk_source_dir>
# You can specify the SuperBuild install prefix with -DSUPERBUILD_INSTALL_PREFIX=...
# By default, it will be installed in <builddir>/Install
cmake ..
make -j <njobs>
```   
   
Export the VMTK_DIR or VMTKHOME variable to the install directory to make it available to AngioTK.

For all those libraries, you might need to setup `PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` ... or use the module command.

### Angiotk

To build the angiotk environment, first clone the angiotk repository.

Then build and activate modules that you require.   
For example, if you only want to enable the `Meshing` module:
```   
cmake /home/aancel/git/angiotk -DBUILD_MODULE_Meshing=ON
```

If your build fails, then the problem must come from the previous installations that you have done. Please re-check them.
