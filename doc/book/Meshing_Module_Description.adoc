# The Meshing Module

The goal here is to generate a 3D mesh of the blood vessels visible in the MRI. In order to reach this goal, the data must undergo several processing steps which are detailed below.

## Segmentation & Surface extraction (VMTK)
Image segmentation is used to detect blood vessels in the MRIs. Blood vessels surfaces are extracted (using a level-set method).

## Center lines definition (VTK)
Blood vessels center lines are defined and can be corrected by hand using a graphical tool. For each center line point, the inscribed sphere is also stored.

## Center lines processing (VMTK,VTK)
A 3D-mesh is created, defining the center lines. Smoothing of the mesh is performed using splines.

## Image reconstruction (VMTK,VTK)
Using the center lines and a computed signed distance function, we generate a high quality, artifact-free image with controlled precision.

## Surface extraction (VMTK)
Here we extract the blood vessels surfaces based on the zero level of the distance function. The resulting mesh is smoothed and remeshed if necessary.

## Simulation mesh construction (GMSH)
The mesh is prepared to be used in computer simulation:

* The ends of the tubular structure are opened.
* Its surface is then remeshed using the center lines.
* Its volume is meshed using the center lines.
* Optionnally, the blood vessels thickness is taken into account by extruding de boundary layer according to a given percentage of the blood vessels radius.
* The Mesh is partitioned for numerical simulation.
