# The master script

The features discussed here are currently only available in the feature/matrix branch.

The master script's purpose is to provide a easy way to process multiple MRI files, collect the results and present them in a convenient way.

## Requirements

All the MRI files must share a common path, which means they should all be located in one directory tree.

This directory tree will be recursively walked through and all the files matching the `.mha` extension will be added to a list of files to process.

TIP: Because the whole directory tree will be walked through, having a directory tree containing only the target files is advised to speed up this process.


## Parallel execution

It is possible to process multiple MRI images in parallel using AngioTK. This is especially useful when processing a lot of MRI files. 

- This is achieved by creating a pool of worker processes and a list of files to process. 
- Each worker process then picks a file and executes the pipeline script asynchronously.
- Whenever a worker has finished running the script, it picks an other file and start over, until all the files of the list have been processed.

## Results Matrix



## Running the master script

The master script is a python script taking at least these two arguments:

- _--inputpath_ : (string) the common path to all input files.
- _--outputpath_ : (string) the path to write results.

The following arguments are optional:

- _-n_ : (default:-1) limit the maximum number of files to process. Usefull for quick tests. Negative values disable this limit.
- _-p_ : (default:1) the number of worker processes (i.e. the maximum number of files to process simultaneously).
- _--noscreenshots_ : a switch to disable screenshots rendering.

## Example

Let's assume we have a directory `/data/IRM` containing IRM files `IRM001.mha`, `IRM002.mha`

We choose a directory to store results: `/data/angiotk_results`

All we need now is to launch the master script:

	python  $INSTALL/master.py --inputpath /data/IRM --outputpath /data/angiotk_results
	
`INSTALL` is the path where AngioTK was installed.

After the script's execution, `/data/angiotk_results` will contain:

- two directories `IRM001_mha` and `IRM002_mha`, each corresponding to an AngioTK pipeline normal output (when using the normal script `runAngioTKPipeline.py`, this is what `--outputpath` refers to)
- an additionnal directory called `resultsDataBase`. This directory will contain all the metadata about angiotk run(s), including the screenshots.

## Results Database

The `resultsDataBase` directory contains an web page file named `summary.html` and a few related files as well as a `runs` directory.

### summary web page

This page presents a list of angiotk runs. It is populated dynamically with the metadata stored in `summary.json`.

### runs directory

Each time the master script is executed, a new directory is created inside de `runs` directory. Its name is composed of a prefix (`run`) followed by the date and time of execution.
