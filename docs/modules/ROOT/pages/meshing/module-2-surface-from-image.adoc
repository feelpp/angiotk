= Surface extraction

The goal of this module is to extract and create a 3D model of the surface of the blood
vessels, using a level set method.
The level sets are initialized using either the isosurface of a given intensity
value (*isosurface* method) or a given intensity range (*threshold* method).
A marching cube algorithm then extracts the surface.

== Surface subdivision

The resulting surface can be subdivided using 3 methods:

*linear*:: (original points are preserved and linear subdivisions are created in
  between),
*butterfly*:: (original points are preserved and new points are added)
*loop*:: (original points are displaced and new points are added).

NOTE: The difference between the last two is the smoothness they tend to bend
the surface to: C^1 for *butterfly*, C^2 for *loop*.

The executable we use is named `meshing_surfacefromimage`.
