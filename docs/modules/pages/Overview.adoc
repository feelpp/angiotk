# Overview

## Introduction
The AngioTK project's aim is to allow computer simulation (fluid dynamics, particle tracing) in 3D models of blood vessels reconstructed automatically from medical images (MRI files).

Therefore, AngioTK is structured as a pipeline whose initial input - the MRI files - are carried and transformed throughout multiple processes ordered as follows:

`[MRI FILE] -> 1.Filtering -> 2.Mesh Generation -> 3.Computer Fluid Dynamics -> 4.Particle Tracing`

Each of these processes corresponds to a dedicated software module:

## 1.Filtering Module (ITK/Medipy/RORPO/VMTK)

Images are filtered to prepare them for mesh extraction and made isotropic if necessary. 

The main goal here is to highlight tubular structures so they can be extracted in the next step. This is accomplished by RORPO. See link:Module_1_RORPO.adoc[RORPO] for more information on using it.

## 2.Meshing Module (VTK/VMTK/GMSH)

A 3D mesh is generated by extracting the tubular structure of blood vessels from the images. Some final filtering is then applied to correct and smooth the resulting geometry.

Further information and a detailed description of the different steps involved are available link:Meshing_Module_Description.adoc[here]

## 3.CFD Module (Feel++)

Runs computer fluid dynamics code to simulate blood flow in the veins and arteries modeled by the mesh.

## 4.Particle Tracer Module (Paraview)
Useful to visualize particle trajectories inside the blood vessels.
