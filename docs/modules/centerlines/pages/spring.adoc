This is an example of mesh generation using {angiotk}.

== How does it work

Using very simple geometric description of the shape of the mesh we
want to produce, {angiotk} can produce a tubular structure mesh.

=== Geometry file

We start with a geometry file: `spring.geo`.
This file is a _Gmsh_ script that defines the spring skeleton as a chain of
line segments:

=== Center line computing

{angiotk} uses this chain of line segments to generate a center line, which is
equipped with a radius.
This means each point of the center line has an associated scalar value which
describes the radius of the final tubular structure at this point.
This radius is defined in a configuration file named `centerlinesmanager.cfg`

=== 3D Image generation

Using the center line, {angiotk} now builds a 3D image.
This 3D image corresponds to a discretized volume in which the exterior and
the interior of the final mesh are marked:

=== Surface extraction

Now, {angiotk} applies image segmentation algorithms to the 3D image to
extract the surface of the final mesh.

=== Surface remeshing

{angiotk} calls _Gmsh_ to remesh the surface, cut and open its ends.

=== Volume meshing

{angiotk} meshes the volume using the remeshed surface.

NOTE: The color of the faces is here to indicate distinct surfaces.
This will be used to impose boundary conditions to perform numerical
simulations.

== Generating the full mesh

[source, sh]
----
sh runpipeline.sh --angiotk <location of {angiotk} executables> --cfg <location of {angiotk} config files>
----

TIP: Both arguments are optional. By default, {angiotk} executables are
supposed to be in `/usr/local/bin`, and the configuration files are looked for
in your current directory.

=== In Docker

In Docker, {angiotk} executables are all in `usr/local/bin` - so you don't
need the `--angiotk` argument - and the results of the pipeline are stored in
`/feel/angiotk/spring`.

This means generating the mesh is very easy:

[source, sh]
----
$ clone https://github.com/feelpp/angiotk #
$ cd angiotk/docs/modules/centerlines/examples/spring
$ ./
----


// Once the files are generated you are ready to use {feelpp} toolboxes
