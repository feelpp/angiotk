# Getting AngioTK sample data

To get the data associated to the AngioTK project, you must first configure the [pydas](https://github.com/midasplatform/pydas) python module.

The installation instructions are:
- First install `pip` either through your package manager or with [this link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/).
- Then install pydas with `pip install pydas` (see [link](https://pydas.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html)). You might want to specify an installation directory with the `--target` pip option.
- (If necessary) Make pydas accessible by adding the directory, where the pydas directory is located, in the `PYTHONPATH` variable.
